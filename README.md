# WebSocket Connector

A lightweight C# WebSocket client library designed for simple, real-time communication between an application like Streamerbot and a WebSocket server.

---

## Features

- Connects to any WebSocket server.
- Sends and receives string messages.
- Event-driven design for handling incoming messages and connection state.
- Minimal dependenciesâ€”easy to drop into most C# projects.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) or later  
  *(Project can be adapted for .NET Framework or earlier .NET Core if needed)*

### Installation

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/websocket-connector.git
cd websocket-connector
```

### Usage in Streamerbot

Basic Example of c# code in streamerbot to turn an effect ON.

Set argument in streamerbot to the filter name.

You can open the plugin in reshade to see a list of available filters - click to copy the name!

Sample import code for streamerbot included.

```
using System;
using System.Net.Sockets;
using System.Text;

public class CPHInline
{
    public bool Execute()
    {
        // You can pass effectName as an argument/variable from Streamer.bot
        string effectName = args.ContainsKey("effectName") ? args["effectName"].ToString() : "MotionBlur";

        try
        {
            using (TcpClient client = new TcpClient())
            {
                client.Connect("127.0.0.1", 7777);
                NetworkStream stream = client.GetStream();

                string command = $"ON {effectName}\n";
                byte[] data = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(command);
                stream.Write(data, 0, data.Length);

                // Read response
                byte[] buffer = new byte[256];
                int bytes = stream.Read(buffer, 0, buffer.Length);
                string response = Encoding.ASCII.GetString(buffer, 0, bytes);

                CPH.SendMessage($"ReShade response: {response}");
            }
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            CPH.SendMessage($"Error: {ex.Message}");
            return false;
        }

        return true;
    }
}

```
