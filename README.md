                         STREAMERBOT INTEGRATION


Basic Setup:
1. Create a new Action in Streamerbot
2. Add an arguement to set the effectname
2. Add a "Execute C# Code" sub-action
3. Paste the integration code (see below)
4. Configure trigger (chat command, channel point reward, etc.)

Integration Code:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Net.Sockets;
using System.Text;

public class CPHInline
{
    public bool Execute()
    {
        // Get effect name from arguments or use default
        string effectName = args.ContainsKey("effectName") ? args["effectName"].ToString() : "MotionBlur";
        string action = args.ContainsKey("action") ? args["action"].ToString() : "TOGGLE";
        
        try
        {
            using (TcpClient client = new TcpClient())
            {
                // Connect to StreamerbotControl addon
                client.Connect("127.0.0.1", 7777);
                NetworkStream stream = client.GetStream();
                
                // Send command
                string command = $"{action} {effectName}\n";
                byte[] data = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(command);
                stream.Write(data, 0, data.Length);
                
                // Read response
                byte[] buffer = new byte[256];
                int bytes = stream.Read(buffer, 0, buffer.Length);
                string response = Encoding.ASCII.GetString(buffer, 0, bytes);
                
                CPH.SendMessage($"‚úÖ ReShade: {response.Trim()}");
            }
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            CPH.SendMessage($"‚ùå ReShade Error: {ex.Message}");
            return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

Advanced Integration Examples:

Chat Command Integration:
```csharp
// For !blur command
string command = "TOGGLE MotionBlur\n";

// For !sharpen on/off commands  
string action = args["rawInput"].ToString().Contains("on") ? "ENABLE" : "DISABLE";
string command = $"{action} LumaSharpen\n";
```

Channel Points Reward:
```csharp
// Different effects for different rewards
string rewardName = args["rewardName"].ToString();
string command = "";

switch(rewardName.ToLower())
{
    case "motion blur":
        command = "TOGGLE MotionBlur\n";
        break;
    case "rainbow mode":
        command = "ENABLE ChromaticAberration\n";
        break;
    case "clean view":
        command = "DISABLE MotionBlur\n";
        break;
}
```


                            COMMAND REFERENCE


Command Format:
<ACTION> <technique_name>

Available Actions:
- TOGGLE: Switch effect on/off
- ENABLE / ON: Turn effect on
- DISABLE / OFF: Turn effect off

Example Commands:
TOGGLE MotionBlur
ENABLE ChromaticAberration  
DISABLE SMAA
ON LumaSharpen
OFF DepthOfField

Effect Name Matching:
- Exact Match: TOGGLE MotionBlur (exact technique name)
- Partial Match: TOGGLE Blur (matches any technique containing "Blur")
- Case Insensitive: Commands and effect names are case-insensitive

                      MONITORING & DIAGNOSTICS


Server Status Indicators:
- üü¢ Running (Healthy): Server active and responsive
- üî¥ Running (Unhealthy): Server running but unresponsive  
- ‚ö´ Stopped: Server not running

Activity Log:
The built-in activity log shows:
- Server start/stop events
- Client connections and disconnections
- Commands received and processed
- Error messages and diagnostics
- Auto-restart attempts

Health Monitoring:
- Heartbeat Tracking: Server health checked every second
- Connection Monitoring: Client status and IP addresses
- Command Statistics: Total commands received counter
- Restart Tracking: Failed restart attempt counting


                            TROUBLESHOOTING


Common Issues:

"Server failed to start"
- Check if port 7777 is already in use
- Try a different port number
- Ensure Windows Firewall allows the connection

"Connection refused from Streamerbot"
- Verify server is running (check ReShade overlay)
- Confirm port numbers match
- Check if antivirus is blocking connections

"Effects not changing"
- Use "Show Available Techniques" to see exact effect names
- Try partial matching (e.g., "Blur" instead of "MotionBlur")
- Check ReShade overlay for error messages

"Server keeps restarting"
- Check Windows Firewall and antivirus settings
- Try disabling auto-restart temporarily
- Look for error patterns in the activity log

Debug Steps:
1. Check Server Status in ReShade overlay
2. Test with Telnet:
   telnet localhost 7777
   TOGGLE MotionBlur
3. Review Activity Log for error messages
4. Try Manual Restart using the "Restart Server" button
5. Verify Effect Names using "Show Available Techniques"


                      ALTERNATIVE CLIENT APPLICATIONS

While designed for Streamerbot, the TCP interface works with any application:

Python Example:
```python
import socket

def toggle_effect(effect_name):
    with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:
        s.connect(('localhost', 7777))
        s.sendall(f'TOGGLE {effect_name}\n'.encode())
        response = s.recv(1024).decode()
        print(f"Response: {response}")

toggle_effect("MotionBlur")
```

PowerShell Example:
```powershell
$client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TcpClient
$client.Connect("127.0.0.1", 7777)
$stream = $client.GetStream()
$writer = New-Object System.IO.StreamWriter($stream)
$writer.WriteLine("TOGGLE MotionBlur")
$writer.Flush()
```

Command Line (Telnet):
telnet localhost 7777
ENABLE ChromaticAberration
